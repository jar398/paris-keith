This directory contains a program and datafile used in generating categories of human genes homologous to hits from RNAi screens found in the Flight database.

1) Browse for screens of interest in 
http://flight.licr.org/browse/browse_rnai.jsp
2) Click on a screen of interest
3) Create a file for the data; I used ###.txt, where ### is a serial number
4) The first two lines should read
PMID:####
SCREEN:An RNAi Screen

The first line specifies the PubMedId for the citation, which replaces ####
The second line gives the description that will be placed in the category

Example:

PMID: 15547975
SCREEN: Terminal Cytokinesis Events

5) Copy-and-paste the data table from Flight below these two header lines

6) When you have all the files set up, run

flight.pl *.txt 

7) A new flight.sigs file will be created
